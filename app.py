    ### Key Factors in Loan Approval
    
    - **Age**: Lenders consider age as a factor for stability and repayment capability.
    - **Income**: Higher income indicates better ability to repay the loan.
    - **Loan Amount**: The amount you're borrowing relative to your income affects risk assessment.
    - **Credit Score**: Higher scores indicate better credit history and lower risk.
    - **Loan Term**: The length of time for repayment affects monthly payments and overall interest.
    - **Employment Years**: Longer employment history suggests job stability.
